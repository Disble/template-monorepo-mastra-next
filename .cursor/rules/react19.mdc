# React 19 Conventions

- Prefer new form and action primitives where applicable: `useActionState`, `useFormStatus`.
- Use `use()` inside `<Suspense>` for Promise handling in server components where appropriate.
- Ref handling: refs can be passed as props; only use `forwardRef` when required by external APIs.
- Migrate Shadcn components to ref-as-prop where compatible; keep types correct with `React.ComponentProps<typeof X>`.
- Keep types up-to-date with latest `@types/react`. Ensure `tsconfig.json` is compatible with React 19 settings.

Troubleshooting:
- For ref-related issues, audit components still using legacy `forwardRef` unnecessarily.
- Verify JSX settings and ensure no conflicting React versions.
