# Project Architecture and Development Guidelines

This is a Next.js 16 application using the App Router with Tailwind CSS v4 and HeroUI components.

### Code Quality Principles

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication through reusable components and custom hooks
- **SOLID Principles**: Apply object-oriented design principles for maintainable React Native architecture
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Favor simple solutions over complex ones
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Avoid adding functionality until it is necessary
- **Modern Standards**: Use current ECMAScript features, TypeScript strict mode, and React Native best practices
- **TypeScript Paths**: Use configured path aliases (@Components, @Hooks, @Utils, etc.)
- **Platform Awareness**: Consider iOS and Android differences in implementation
